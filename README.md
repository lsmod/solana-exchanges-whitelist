# Solana Exchanges Whitelist

This is a list of Exchanges where you can withdraw SOL ([solana blockchain](https://solana.com)). Exchanges personally tested.

- [FTX](https://ftx.com/): SOL and SPL tokens\*
- [crypto.com](https://crypto.com): SOL only
- [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/): SOL only
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com): SOL and RAY \
  (be wary sometimes binance freeze withdrawal for few days)

\*This means that you can withdraw token that are on the solana blockchain. For example USDC as a SPL token can go to your solana's non custodian wallet. See [FTX supported asset list](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055304412-Supported-Assets-) for more details.
